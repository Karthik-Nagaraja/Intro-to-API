    "So far, we've been making GET requests. We use GET requests to retrieve information from a server (hence the name GET). There are a few other types of API requests.\n",
    "For example, we use POST requests to send information (instead of retrieve it), and to create objects on the API's server. With the GitHub API, we can use POST requests to create new repositories.\n",
    "Different API endpoints choose what types of requests they will accept. Not all endpoints will accept a POST request, and not all will accept a GET request. You'll have to consult the API's documentation to figure out which endpoints accept which types of requests.\n",
    "We can make POST requests using requests.post. POST requests almost always include data, because we need to send the data the server will use to create the new object.\n",
    "We pass in the data in a way that's very similar to what we do with query parameters and GET requests:\n",
    "payload = {\"name\": \"test\"}\n",
    "requests.post(\"https://api.github.com/user/repos\", json=payload)\n",
    "The code above will create a new repository named test under the account of the currently authenticated user. It will convert the payload dictionary to JSON, and pass it along with the POST request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out GitHub's API documentation for repositories to see a full list of what data we can pass in with this POST request. Here are just a couple data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "    name -- Required, the name of the repository\n",
    "    description -- Optional, the description of the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful POST request will usually return a 201 status code indicating that it was able to create the object on the server. Sometimes, the API will return the JSON representation of the new object as the content of the response."

    "PUT/PATCH Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to update an existing object, rather than create a new one. This is where PATCH and PUT requests come into play.\n",
    "We use PATCH requests when we want to change a few attributes of an object, but don't want to resend the entire object to the server. Maybe we just want to change the name of our repository, for example.\n",
    "We use PUT requests to send the complete object we're revising as a replacement for the server's existing version.\n",
    "In practice, API developers don't always respect this convention. Sometimes API endpoints that accept PUT requests will treat them like PATCH requests, and not require us to send the whole object back.\n",
    "We send a payload of data with PATCH requests, the same way we do with POST requests:\n",
    "payload = {\"description\": \"The best repository ever!\", \"name\": \"test\"}\n",
    "response = requests.patch(\"https://api.github.com/repos/VikParuchuri/test\", json=payload)\n",

    "A successful PATCH request will usually return a 200 status code."
